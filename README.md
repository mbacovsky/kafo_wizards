# KafoWizards


With this gem it is possible to define form or wizard and display it to the user using one of the defined backends. The form definition is independent on the chosen backend so it can be changed freely. Currently only command line (highline) backend is implemented, YAD or web based backend is planed.

Warning: The code is still very unstable

## Installation

    gem 'kafo_wizards'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install kafo_wizards

require 'kafo_wizards'
require 'awesome_print'

wizard.entries = [
  f.string(:username, :default_value => 'admin', :required => true),
  f.password(:password, :label => 'Password', :required => true),
  f.button(:register, :label => 'Register new account', :default => true),
